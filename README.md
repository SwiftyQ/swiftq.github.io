### README for GitHub
We have divided our static and executable files into three major folders for readability and maintenance:
* Templates: this folder contains all the html files for the website; every page has html code of its own—index.html, signup.html, request.html, inbox.html, chat.html, achievement.html
* Static: this folder contains all the backend javascript files, css code, as well as all the images and database for our application
* - Js folder: contains javascript code for event-handling and user-input interaction for our HTML documents
* -  Css folder: contains css code for displaying different HTML elements on the web browser
* Server.py: contains code for the server process that allows web browser interactive access to the HTML files
* Docs: this folder contains the milestone reports that have been submitted so far
### Libraries and frameworks:
* Bootstrap: framework for displaying HTML elements
*  jQuery: framework for document traversal and event handling
*  Python-flask: micro web framework for developing the web server
* sqlite3: embedded SQL database for manipulating user data
* socket.io: framework for chatting—allows bidirectional communication
